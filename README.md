# Red-Wine-Quality

The project consists of SVM evaluations using 3 types of kernels - Gaussian/RBF, Sigmoid, and Polynomial.

According to the confusion matrix and classification report, the kernel SVM that is least error prone is the Polynomial Kernel. This may be because of the number of features used for making predictions. It performs slightly better than the RBF kernel.
